The {{< newtabref href="https://www.focalboard.com" title="Focalboard" >}} / {{< newtabref href="https://mattermost.com/boards" title="Mattermost Boards" >}} project is written in {{< newtabref href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" title="TypeScript" >}} and {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/" title="Go" >}}.

From Mattermost v7.11, Mattermost Boards is a core part of the product that cannot be disabled or built separately. Developers should read the updated [Developer Guide]({{< ref "/contribute/developer-setup" >}}) for details.

The codebase for Focalboard Personal Editions was separated from the ongoing Mattermost Boards Plugin code on March 09, 2023. Weâ€™ll be transitioning Focalboard Personal Server and Personal Desktop editions to being fully community supported as of April 30th, 2023.

For working with Focalboard as a standalone application, please refer to the [Personal Server Setup Guide]({{< ref "/contribute/more-info/focalboard/personal-server-setup-guide" >}}).
